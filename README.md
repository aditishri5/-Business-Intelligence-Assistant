**Project Objective:**

An innovative Business Intelligence Assistant, aims to address these challenges by developing an automated AI model using advanced technologies,
including LangChain, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Large Language Models (LLMs). 

 **This model aims to:** 
**Part 1: AI-Powered Business Intelligence Assistant**
**Analyze business data:** Perform comprehensive analysis to identify key trends and patterns. 

**Generate insights and recommendations:** Utilize natural language processing to deliver actionable business insights.

**Following Steps are performed in this project:**
**1.  Data preparation** 
Focus on analyzing and extracting insights from pre-prepared data, rather than on data cleaning 
**2. Knowledge base creation** 
Load and explore the dataset 
Organize the data into a structured format suitable for retrieval and analysis 
**3. LLM application development** 
**Advanced data summary:** Analyze the data to identify key metrics and trends, including: 
Sales performance by time period 
Product and regional analysis 
Customer segmentation by demographics 
Statistical measures (e.g., median, standard deviation) 
**Integration with RAG System:** 
Utilize pandas for data processing 
Develop a custom retriever to extract relevant statistics 
Implement prompt engineering to guide the LLM in generating accurate responses 
**4. Chain prompts**
Design prompts to ensure the LLM produces coherent and contextually relevant responses 
**5. RAG system setup**
Implement the RAG system to enhance the LLMâ€™s ability to generate detailed and accurate responses based on retrieved data 
**6. Memory integration**
Integrate memory systems to enable the model to retain and use contextual information from previous interactions, thereby improving the relevance of responses 
**Part 2: LLMOps (Model Evaluation,and Monitoring)** 
**7. External tool integration** 
Model evaluation: Apply QAEvalChain to assess the model's performance and accuracy
